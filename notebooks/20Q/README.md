# 20 Questions game project

The goal of this project is to use scikit-learn to train a decision tree, and use that to play a 20 questions game. There are already very good games like this online, such as [20q.net/](http://20q.net/) (which is an old one, though neural net based -- and for training data, it uses the games that people play against it).

The template for the project is in [setup_sportsDataset.ipynb](setup_sportsDataset.ipynb)
