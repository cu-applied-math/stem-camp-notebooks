### ipynb notebooks not rendering
Do you ever get the error message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when clicking on a `ipynb` file? If so, try refreshing the page a few times. If that doesn't resolve it soon (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't), then you can try either
1. go to <https://colab.research.google.com/> directly and "open" the file using the github interface
2. view the file by going to <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/> and pasting in the URL
