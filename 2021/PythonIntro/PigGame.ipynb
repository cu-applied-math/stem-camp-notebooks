    "To start with, read about the game of PIG at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game). The game has two players take turns playing rounds until one player reaches a score of 100. For now, let's start by examining what happens at a single round. At a round, the player rolls the dice and gets a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. If they get a 1, their turn is over; otherwise, they get the score of the dice. Then they can choose to \"hit\" (and roll again), or \"stay\" (and end their turn). If they hit and get a 1, they lose all the points they've earned in that round. If they stay, then they keep all the points, but can't earn any more points as their round is over.\n",
