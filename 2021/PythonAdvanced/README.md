# Intermediate/Advanced level Python notebooks

The most interesting notebook is the [A_Search_Student.ipynb](A_Search_Student.ipynb) notebook ([open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/PythonAdvanced/A_Search_Student.ipynb) or [view notebook via nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/PythonAdvanced/A_Search_Student.ipynb)) which is about [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithms for route planning. 

The [../PythonIntro/PigGame.ipynb](../PythonIntro/PigGame.ipynb) is also an advanced project.
