        "It might seem obvious that the more stories a building has, the taller it is in feet, and vice versa. Linear regression exploits this idea. Let's say I'm a professor researching buildings and stories, and I want to use the # of stories in a building to estimate its height in feet. I can easily stand outside a building and see how many stories it has, but my tape measurer won't reach many of the roofs in Denver. I do know that the two-story building I live in is right around 20 feet high. My idea is to take the number of stories, and multiply by 10.something, but I'm not sure this will work for other buildings (commercial and industrial buildings for example).\n",

How can I combine all 60 observations to get a good answer? One could naively just take the average of all of these numbers, but in higher dimensions this doesn't work. To help, we have a statistical technique called linear regression. I can use regression to find a good number to multiply the number of stories by (call it $\\beta$), and I hope this will help me get an accurate prediction for the height. I know this height will not be exactly right, so there is some error in each prediction. If I write this all out, we have  \n",
