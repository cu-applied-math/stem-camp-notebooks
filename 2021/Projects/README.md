# Projects

For Friday

## 20 Questions game project
The goal of this project is to use scikit-learn to train a decision tree, and use that to play a 20 questions game. There are already very good games like this online, such as [20q.net/](http://20q.net/) (which is an old one, though neural net based -- and for training data, it uses the games that people play against it).

We'll do a simplified version of 20 questions that has you think of a sport (out of a list of prechosen sports), then the computer asks you questios (like, "Does the sport involve a ball?") and the computer will try to guess which sport you're thinking of.

The template for the project is in [20Qsports_template.ipynb](20Qsports_template.ipynb) ([colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/Projects/20Qsports_template.ipynb), or [view notebook via nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/Projects/20Qsports_template.ipynb))


One possible set of solutions is [20Qsports_StephensSolution.ipynb](20Qsports_StephensSolution.ipynb) ([colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/Projects/20Qsports_StephensSolution.ipynb), or [view notebook via nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks/blob/master/2021/Projects/20Qsports_StephensSolution.ipynb))
